# Advanced

## Hiding Choices

As of version [10.31](https://github.com/botpress/botpress/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#10310-2018-08-08), you are able to configure the choice skill to handle a choice but stop it from being displayed to the user in the conversation. This allows you top handle edge cases or unpopular conversation paths without cluttering up the user interface for most users.

Options can be hidden by prefixing ether the title or the message with `!hide`. 

In the example used below we have added the `!hide` flag to the option of Pineapple in both the Choices Message (this is the button that gets shown to the user) and the Value (this is what the bot receives when the button is selected).

> **Note**: A Choice skill cannot be affed to the flow if it only has a hidden option. If only hidden choices are present the insert button will be disabled

## Choice and NLU

With the choice skill you are able to link a choice item (pineapple in the above example) with an intent in your NLU model.

Continuing on from the example above, add a model for pineapple. In the NLU tab, create a new intent called `fruit_pineapple`. `fruit_` is used to group the intents together for our example choice, "pick a fruit".

Then add some utterances that a user my use to describe a pineapple. We have gone for `green and orange` and `spiky`.

Now back in your choice skill, add the tag of `intent:fruit_pineapple`. This means that if a user were to type in ether of our utterances above, the choice of `pineapple` would be selected by the bot.
