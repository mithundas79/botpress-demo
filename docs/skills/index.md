# Skills

After building a couple of flows/bots, youâ€™ll quickly notice that there are some common patterns that you find yourself implementing over and over. This is where skills come to the rescue.

Skills are higher-level abstractions on top of flows. In fact, skills are dynamic flow generators.

They can be seen as reusable components between multiple flows or even multiple bots.

# Installing 

Skill can be installed from the npm registry. They have the naming convention of `@botpress/skill-`

```js
// using npm
npm i @botpress/skill-<skill-name>
// using yarn 
yarn add @botpress/skill-<skill-name>
```

Once installed, restart your bot and the skill will be automatically detected and loaded by your bot.

# Using a skill

Skills are added to the flow of your bot using the Botpress Flows GUI.

You will find a dropdown list in the toolbar to `Insert Skill`
