The flow-editor allows you to visually design the flow of the conversation. However, it may be easier for you to jump to a specific conversation node programmatically, when a specific set of conditions is met. 

```js
// inside a bp.hear (...)
const stateId = event.sessionId || event.user.id;
await bp.dialogEngine.jumpTo(stateId, 'main.flow.json', 'target-node', { resetState: true })
await bp.dialogEngine.processMessage(stateId, event) // Continue processing
```

As can be seen in the above example, the `jumpTo` method takes 4 arguments:
 - the state id
 - the target flow name 
 - the target node name (optional - by default it is flow.startNode)
 - an options-object, with the `resetState` key set to true (by default state doesnâ€™t get reset).
