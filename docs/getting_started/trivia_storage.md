# ðŸ“š Storage Mechanisms

Even though Botpress has a built-in database, it aims to abtract most of the storage for you to simplify data management. Botpress does that by providing high-level APIs.

## Per-conversation storage

In the context of a conversation, data should in most cases be stored in the **state** itself (see [actions](../trivia_actions)).

### Alternatives

If for some reason you don't want to store the data in the state (perhaps it is too large or too sensitive), we recommend you retrieve the `stateId` from the state. You can then use that `stateId` as the key for your external storage mechanism.

```js
storeLargePayload: state => {
  const stateId = state._stateId
  // Store something huge somewhere using the stateId as key
  return
},
```

## Per-user storage

If you want to store things about your users and you want that information to be persisted across multiple conversations, we suggest you use `User Tags`.

```js
storeAge: async (state, event) => {
  const userId = event.user.id

  // Set the age
  // Value can be anything, it will get serialized
  await event.bp.users.tag(userId, 'age', 12)

  // Get the age back
  const age = await event.bp.users.getTag(userId, 'age')

  // Delete the age
  await event.bp.users.untag(userId, 'age')

  return
},
```

### Alternatives

If you prefer to store this information somewhere else, you can use the `userId` as the key for external storage.

```js
storeLargePayload: (state, event) => {
  const userId = event.user.id
  // Store something huge somewhere using the userId as key
  return
},
```

## Global storage

If you want to store things globally, you can use the built-in [Key-Value-Store (KVS)](https://botpress.io/docs/latest/recipes/dbs/).

```js
storeGlobal: async (state, event) => {
  const kvs = event.bp.kvs

  // Set global variable
  await kvs.set('winner', { name: 'Joe' })


  // Get global variable
  const winner = await kvs.get('winner')

  return
},
```

## Full database

If none of the above works for you, you might want to consider using a built-in database (SQLite or Postgres). This is the most flexible option but obviously comes with more work on your end, as you'll have to manually create and maintain tables, rows and write SQL queries.

Botpress uses the great [**knex**](http://knexjs.org) library to abstract the database layer. You may get an instance of `knex` with the following code:

```js
// If you have access to `bp` directly
const knex = await bp.db.get()

// Instead if you have an event:
const knex = await event.bp.db.get()
```

# ðŸ”¨ Leaderboard

Now that we understand how to store data, how to write custom actions and how flows work, we have all the tools we need to finish implementing our leaderboard.

## Scoring system

To determine the score of the user, we will take into account two variables:

* The total time it took to respond to all the questions
* The total score

The score will be determined as follow: `SCORE / TIME_IN_MILLISECONDS * 1000 * 5000`

### Computing total time

To calculate the total time to answer, we will modify the `startGame` action to store the start time:

```diff
startGame: state => {
  return {
    ...state, // we clone the existing state
+    startTime: new Date(),
    count: 0, // we then reset the number of questions asked to `0`
    score: 0 // and we reset the score to `0`
  }
},
```

Then we will create a new action called `endGame` as follow.

> **Note:** Don't forget to import `moment` at the top of your file: `const moment = require('moment')`

```js
endGame: state => {
  // assuming you declared moment at the top of this file
  // const moment = require('moment')
  const totalTimeInMs = moment().diff(moment(state.startTime))
  const totalScore = parseInt(state.score / totalTimeInMs * 1000 * 5000)

  return {
    ...state,
    totalScore: totalScore
  }
},
```

## Storing top scores in KVS

Now that the performance of the player is quantified, we can start recording a list of the best scores. Let's create an action that amends the leaderboard:

```js
amendLeaderboard: async (state, event) => {
  // Let's pull our existing leaderboard or create an empty board if it doesn't exist
  let board = (await event.bp.kvs.get('leaderboard')) || []

  board.push({
    score: state.totalScore,
    date: moment().format('dd MMM YYYY, hA'),
    nickname: state.nickname
  })

  // Now let's take the top 5 only and re-save it
  board = _.take(_.orderBy(board, ['score'], ['desc']), 5)
  await event.bp.kvs.set('leaderboard', board)

  // Are we in top 5? (i.e. are we in the array)
  const doesRanking = !!_.find(board, {
    score: state.totalScore,
    nickname: state.nickname
  })

  return {
    ...state,
    leaderboard: board,
    doesRanking: doesRanking
  }
},
```

Notice how we make use of the global storage (`event.bp.kvs`) to store the leaderboard, which is merely an ordered array of the best scores.

## Wrapping up

Now that we have the single action that is in charge of storing the scores and determining if we're making the ranking or not, we need to consume that action in the flow.

This is very straightforward, so we'll skip the details:

![Leaderboard flow nodes][leaderboard]

## Note A

We need to pull the nickname in the state right after setting it to make sure that the state contains the user's nickname at all times.

## Note B

This is a simple action that calls the specified renderer and pass-throughs all the arguments. In this case, we're using the `#leaderboard` renderer (which we will define in a minute).

> This is a new concept that you probably didn't know existed: we can call renderers directly in actions.
>
> You can call **`event.reply(rendererName, data)`**, which is just slightly different than sending Content Elements (they start with `#!` instead of `#`).

### The `#leaderboard` renderer

Add the following renderer in your `renderer.js` file:

```js
leaderboard: data => ({
  text: data.leaderboard
    .map((entry, i) => `${i + 1}. ${entry.nickname} with ${entry.score}`) //
    .join('\r\n'),
  typing: '2s'
})
```
